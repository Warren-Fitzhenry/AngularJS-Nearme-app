# AngularJS-Nearme-app

# Description

This is an Angular JS / Leaflet Map application that finds wikipedia locations around a selected point.

Once you click on the map, the Wikipedia API is called with the location co-ordinates, and places of interest will appear on the map, where you can click on them to read the articles.
